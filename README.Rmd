bonsai provides bindings for additional tree-based model engines for use with the [parsnip](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/) package. 

This package is based off of the work done in the [treesnip repository](https://github.com/curso-r/treesnip) by Athos Damiani, Daniel Falbel, and Roel Hogervorst. bonsai is the official CRAN version of the package; new development will reside here.  

## Installation

You can install the most recent official release of bonsai with:

``` r
install.packages("bonsai")
```

You can install the development version of bonsai from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tidymodels/bonsai")
```

## Available Engines

The bonsai package provides additional engines for the models in the following table:

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(parsnip)

parsnip_models <- 
  setNames(nm = get_from_env("models")) |>
  purrr::map_dfr(get_from_env, .id = "model")

library(bonsai)

bonsai_models <- 
  setNames(nm = get_from_env("models")) |>
  purrr::map_dfr(get_from_env, .id = "model")

dplyr::anti_join(
  bonsai_models, parsnip_models, 
  by = c("model", "engine", "mode")
) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

Note that the catboost engine package isn't available on CRAN, and should thus be installed according to [their documentation](https://catboost.ai/docs/en/installation/r-installation-binary-installation).
